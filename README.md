# HoverOverTooltip
This small sample code has written by the use of JQuery framework to make a simple awesome hover tooltip.
There is also one more folder whose name is hover_plugin. It contains plugin version of the same project.So i made a hover.js file which contains same jQuery code as a plugin and imported it to my hoverOverPlugin.html page to provide the functonality of my custom hover() function. As a result it works well again :)
